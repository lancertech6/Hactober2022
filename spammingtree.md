Spanning Tree and Minimum Spanning Tree

Spanning tree
A spanning tree is a sub-graph of an undirected connected graph.
It includes all the vertices of the graph with a minimum possible number of edges.
If a vertex is missed, then it is not a spanning tree.
The edges may or may not have weights assigned to them.
The total number of spanning trees with n vertices that can be created from a complete graph is equal to n(n-2).
Minimum Spanning Tree
A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree in which the sum of the weight of the edges is as minimum as possible.

The minimum spanning tree from a graph is found using the following algorithms:

Prim's Algorithm
Kruskal's Algorithm
Spanning Tree Applications

Computer Network Routing Protocol
Cluster Analysis
Civil Network Planning
